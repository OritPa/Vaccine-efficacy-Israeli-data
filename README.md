# Israel's Covid-19 Data During the 3rd and 4th Waves- Vaccine efficacy
This Analysis is based on Isarael's Ministry of Health data regarding Covid-19 for the time period 1.1.2021 - 7.11.2021 (The data was retrieved from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yvtsanlevy/effectiveness-of-covid19-vaccines-in-israel). During this period, Israel has faced two major waves of Covid-19: Wave no. 3 which lasted from Dec. 2020 till March 2021 and Wave no. 4 that lasted from June 2021 until October 2021. 
One factor that changed the trajectory of the disease, compared to the first and second waves, was the introduction of the vaccine. On Dec. 20 2020, a national vaccination campaign has began, starting with the 60+ age group (full vaccination status requires two doses of Vaccine, administered 3 weeks apart). The majority of vaccines administered in Israel were provided by Pfizer-BioNTech. Following an increase in Covid-19 cases during the summer of 2021 and studies that suggested a decline in immune response after a 6 months period, a third "booster" shot campaign was declared on July 30 2021.

This analysis is divided into 3 parts. The first part shows the correlations between the different variables- by examining the correlations, we can deduce that there is a different pattern between those who are vaccinated and those that are not (suggesting that the vaccine has an effect). Moreover, by examining the correlations between those who are fully vaccinated (3-doses) and those with an expired vaccination status, we can stil see a strong correlation between the two groups, sugessting that some of the vaccine protection remained.

The second part demonstrates the effectiveness of the vaccine in the overall population. We can see the stark contrast in all indices between the unvaccinated group and the vaccinated group (both fully and expired vaccination status).

The third part focuses on the difference between the age groups (0-59 and 60+). Overall, We can see the more impactful influance of the disease on the elderly, as oppose to the young, but we can see the vaccines crucial help in reducing severe illness and death (both in 60+ group and the 0-59 group).
